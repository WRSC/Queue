# Queue

Queue is the competition organisation tool for WRSC.

Teams register for an attempt and Queue decide who compete first.
The tool is designed to guarantee at least one attempt for each team.


```

Register team(s) --> Register attempt --> Waiting --> Race --> Finish --> End
                            |                                    |
                            |                                    |
                        Another attempt <-------------------------
